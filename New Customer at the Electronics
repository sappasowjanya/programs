INPUT

The first line of input is n (1≤n≤100), the number of customers in the queue. The second line of input is the battery percentages of the n customers (positive numbers less than 100) 
the first n - 1 of which are standing in ascending order according to their battery percentage.

OUTPUT

Print the battery percentages of the customers in a line after the new person has been put in his right place in the queue.
