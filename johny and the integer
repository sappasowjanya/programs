/*Johny likes numbers n and k very much. Now Johny wants to find the smallest integer x greater than n, so it is divisible by the number k.

Input Format
You will be given a function with two integers n and k as arguments.

Constraints
1 <= n, k <=10^9

Output Format
Return the smallest integer x > n, so it is divisible by the number k.
